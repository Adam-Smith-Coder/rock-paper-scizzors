# rock-paper-scizzors
The purpose of this project is to create a rock, paper, scizzors game which can be played in the console against a 'computer' opponent.

By completing this project I will have demonstrated by ability to use JavaScript to create a playable game, albeit in the console of the browser, that I can expand upon at a later date to include a GUI.
